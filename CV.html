                <p>My name is Steven Gerrard. I used to be a professional footballer and now I am a professional football coach. 
                    I was born in Liverpool and lived there my entire life until I signed for LA Galaxy and moved to the United States. 
                    I then returned to the UK, this time Scotland, but now I'm back in Liverpool again after a while on the road.</p>
